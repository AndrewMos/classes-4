  <div id="commands">
    <ul>
      <li><strong>git checkout -b</strong></li><br />
      This command creates a new branch in our local Git repository and then switches to it. It is really
      helpful in dividing our work - in most cases, we use model 'branch-per-feature', which means that
      we create a new branch for every feature we're currently working at. For example,
      when we are about to work on login system, before start we should type in console: <br />
      <div class="codebox">
        <code>
          $ git checkout -b login-system
        </code>
      </div> <br />
      And then, we are good to go, as every change that we'll make from that point before merging or checking out
      to another branch will be saved only in branch 'login-system'. <br />
      The benefits of branching include ease of reverting the changes if something goes wrong
      and provision of isolated environment for every change to the codebase (this ensures that
      the master branch always contains production-quality code). <br />
      Note that <br />
      <div class="codebox">
      <code>
        $ git checkout -b login-system
      </code>
      </div> <br />
      and <br />
      <div class="codebox">
        <code>
          $ git branch login-system
          $ git checkout login-system
        </code>
      </div> <br />
      are doing exactly the same thing (but the second one in two steps).
    </ul>
